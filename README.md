This project focuses on a crucial challenge in the financial industry: customer churn. Using a comprehensive dataset, our aim was to deploy predictive analytics to identify key factors contributing to account closures, enabling targeted strategies to mitigate churn and enhance customer retention.

By applying a range of machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and K-NN, we compared performance metrics to identify the most effective solution. Our best-performing model, Gradient Boosting with Hyperparameter Tuning, demonstrated notable precision and recall, indicating a robust predictive capability.

Data preparation was meticulous, involving SMOTE for balancing, label encoding, null handling, and feature analysis to ensure the integrity of the modeling process. The project not only prioritizes the predictive accuracy but also underscores the value of interpretability in model deployment, fostering trust in the model's recommendations.

The implications of this analysis extend beyond the technical realm, impacting business strategy and customer relationship management. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can engage with a more personalized approach, potentially transforming customer experiences and outcomes.
