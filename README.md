## Project Overview

**Challenge:** Customer churn is a pressing issue in the financial sector, directly impacting revenue and profitability. Identifying accounts at risk of closure is key to proactive management and sustaining growth.

**Goal:** Implement predictive analytics to spotlight pivotal factors in customer churn and foster strategies that bolster customer loyalty and business revenue.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study features a binary target variable, several numerical, and categorical feature variables over 10,000 customer records. Variables such as `CreditScore`, `Geography`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, and others were analyzed to discern their influence on churn.

## Data Preparation

**Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE):** Used to balance the dataset, ensuring an equal representation of the target classes.

**Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding:** Transform categorical variables for model ingestion, particularly 'Geography'.

**Null Handling:** Utilized statistical methods to fill missing values and ensure data quality.

## Modeling and Evaluation

### Models Implemented:
A diverse array of models was applied to address churn prediction:

- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks
- Random Forest
- Ensemble Models
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

### Performance Metrics:
Model comparison was based on F1 score, precision, and recall.

### Winning Model:
**Gradient Boosting with Hyperparameter Tuning:** Emerged as the top model, excelling in precision, recall, and F1-score, showcasing minimal false predictions.
